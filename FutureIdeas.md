**Astro DataSci Group Meeting:** 
We all get together, one person presents what they are working on, and they get some help / ideas etc. ★★★★★★★★★★

**Workshop:**
One person presents something they are working on, but the focus is to actively give crit and rework it -- more hands on than above ★★★★

**Consensus Projects:**
We get together and cook up / propose some consensus data science projects. We then work on them as a group with the plan of publishing actual astronomy papers ★★★★★★★

**Visualization:**
A meeting a lot like NYCastroML, but focused on data visualization ★★★★★★

**Gaia:**
A gathering to work on methods with Gaia data ★★★★

**Just get together and work**
★★★★★★★

**Challenge:**
In the model of Adrian's successful data challenge, one person is chosen to present a challenge in data analysis each week (perhaps with a hidden "right answer") and we work together or in small competing teams to solve it ★★★★★
